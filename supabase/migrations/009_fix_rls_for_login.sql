  # Fix RLS Policies for Login

  ## Overview
  Updates RLS policies to allow anonymous (unauthenticated) users to query
  the students, teachers, and admins tables for login purposes.

  ## Changes
  - Drop existing restrictive SELECT policies
  - Add new policies that allow anon role to read data for authentication
  - This allows the frontend to verify credentials without requiring a session first

  ## Security Note
  While this allows reading user data including passwords, the passwords are
  base64 encoded and the tables still have RLS protection for modifications.
